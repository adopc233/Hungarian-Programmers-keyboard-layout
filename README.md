# Hungarian-Programmers-keyboard-layout

Welcome. Here I will show you how to install and configure the “Hungarian (Programmers)” keyboard layout.

1. Download the “hun_prog.exe” file.
2. Run it on your computer.
3. You will see a window where you should type the address where the files for the layout setup should be extracted.
4. Click “Next” if you have done. All it's done by itself.
5. An UAC shield will blink on your taskbar. Select it and click Yes.
6. You will receive a confirmation message where you'll announced that the setup of the layout has finished. Click Close.
7. The layout is ready to use; otherwise you should add it from the language settings.

Also, you have a manual for typing certain characters. It is in the PDF format.

Yours faithfully,
